/**
 * The section library.
 *
 * build.md §2.4 specifies a polymorphic `sections[]` — every page on the site
 * is assembled from an ordered list of typed sections, so an editor can build a
 * campaign story with no engineering help (§6). Fifteen section types are
 * specified; six are implemented here, which is enough to prove the
 * architecture and to render the homepage, a campaign story and a craft page.
 * The remaining nine are Sprint 4 work and are additive — a new type is a new
 * member of this union and a new entry in the registry, nothing else.
 *
 * NOTE ON IMAGES: every image field in the spec is a desktop/mobile PAIR,
 * because the category art-directs both on every banner (addendum A7) and an
 * author must not be able to forget the mobile crop. That is baked into the
 * type as `art: { desktop, mobile }`. Today both carry a placeholder tone
 * rather than an asset, so the pairing is visible in the schema before any
 * photography exists to fill it.
